Kubernetes: Building and Running AI Agents for Production

Chapter 1: Introduction to AI Agents and MCP

Artificial intelligence (AI) is moving beyond simple content creation or
chatbots into something far more powerful: AI agents. Instead of just
answering questions, agents can reason about goals, plan a sequence
of steps, and act on behalf of humans or other systems to accomplish
the goal. They do this by connecting to "tools": the APIs, data sources,
and workflows that give them the ability to affect the real world.

Operating a couple of services is one thing, but operating dozens of them
across teams led to chaos. AI agents fit the same pattern. They are
distributed, ephemeral, and networked workloads that need to scale up
or down depending on demand. They need secure access to
data and tools, often on behalf of users. They need to be
observable so teams can understand and eventually trust what they're
doing. That's why Kubernetes is such a natural place to run them.

Kubernetes alone isn't enough. Out of the box, it doesn't
address agent-specific needs:
- Agents need controlled, dynamic, context-aware policy
  enforcement as they access tools and data on behalf of users
- Teams need visibility into not just whether an agent is running,
  but what it is reasoning about, which tools it is calling, and why
  it is making certain decisions
- Platform teams need to enforce guardrails so agents operate
  safely, consistently, and within organizational policies.
Without these, agents remain risky experiments rather than production-
grade systems. Let's take a closer look.
